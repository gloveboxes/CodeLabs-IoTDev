# Controlling a device from Azure IoT Hub

Azure IoT Hub is a service that enables reliable and secure bi-directional communications between millions of IoT devices and an application back end. In this section you will see how to send cloud-to-device messages to your device to command it to change the color of one of the FEZ HAT leds, using the Device Explorer app as the back end.

Azure IoT Hub also supports a number of protocols including [AMQP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPQ), HTTPS and [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT).

In this lab we are going to publish data to Azure IoT Hub over MQTT and subscript to command messages.

1. Open in Visual Studio the **IoTHubMqttClient.sln** solution located at **Source\Ex4\Begin** folder.

This solution takes advantage of 3 Nuget packages that have already been installed and referenced.


1. The [M2Mqtt Client Library](https://m2mqtt.wordpress.com/using-mqttclient) (Install-Package M2Mqtt)
2. The [Fez Hat Library](https://www.ghielectronics.com/docs/329/fez-hat-developers-guide) (Install-Package GHIElectronics.UWP.Shields.FEZHAT)
3. The [Json.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) library (Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json)

Steps to complete

1. From Device Explorer -> Management Tab -> Right Mouse click you device -> Select Copy Connection String for selected device
2. Modifify the following SecurityManager in the **StartupTask.cs** class, replace the placeholder value with the **device connection string** you just copied in the previous step (note that the curly braces { } 
are _NOT_ part of the connection string and should be _removed_ when you paste in your connection string).  

````C#
SecurityManager cm = new SecurityManager("{Azure IoT Hub Device Connection String}");
````


3. Add code to be execute when the device receives a message from Azure IoT Hub. The following code should be pasted in to the  **Client_MqttMsgPublishReceived** method in the **StartupTask.cs** class.

````C#
switch (message) {
    case "RED":
        hat.D2.Color = new FEZHAT.Color(255, 0, 0);
        break;
    case "GREEN":
        hat.D2.Color = new FEZHAT.Color(0, 255, 0);
        break;
    case "BLUE":
        hat.D2.Color = new FEZHAT.Color(0, 0, 255);
        break;
    case "OFF":
        hat.D2.TurnOff();
        break;
    default:
        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Unrecognized command: {0}", message);
        break;
}
````

Your completed code should look like the following


````C#

###Deploy your app to the Raspberry Pi

1. Press **F5** to deploy and run the app on the device.
2. Once it's loaded, from **Device Explorer** go to the **Messages To Device tab**, 
    - Select your device
    - Check the Monitor Feedback Endpoint option 
    - Write your command in the Message field (red, green or blue). Click on Send to send the command to your Raspberry Pi
3. Try putting a break point in the Client_MqttMsgPublishReceived method, the break point will be hit when the code receives a message

    ![Sending cloud-to-device message](Images/sending-cloud-to-device-message.png?raw=true)

7. After a few seconds the message will be processed by the device and the LED will turn on in the color you selected. The feedback will also be reflected in the Device Explorer screen after a few seconds.
