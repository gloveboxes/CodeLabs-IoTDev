### Setting up your Azure Account


For this lab you will need access to an Azure subscription

If you don’t already have an Azure account, then you will need to provision one.

There are currently two free trail offers – either good for the purposes of the workshop.

1. [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-dev-essentials-vs.aspx) Sign up for free. $25 a month for a year. More slow and steady over an extended period of time.
2. [Free one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/). Sign up for free and get $200 to spend on all Azure services. Great is you really want to exercise lots of Azure capabilities for a limited period of time.

Valid credit card information is required for identity verification purposes only. Your credit card will not be charged for this offer unless you explicitly remove the spending limit.
