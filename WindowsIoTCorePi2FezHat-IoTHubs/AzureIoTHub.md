#### Creating an IoT Hub

1. Enter the Azure portal, by browsing to http://portal.azure.com
2. Create a new IoT Hub. To do this, click **New** in the jumpbar, then click **Internet of Things**, then click **Azure IoT Hub**.

3. Configure the **IoT hub** with the desired information:
 - Enter a **Name** for the hub e.g. _iot-sample_,
 - Select a **Pricing and scale tier** (_F1 Free_ tier is enough),
 - Create a new resource group, or select and existing one. For more information, see [Using resource groups to manage your Azure resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-portal/).
 - Select the **Region** such as _East US_ where the service will be located.

4. It can take a few minutes for the IoT hub to be created. Once it is ready, open the blade of the new IoT hub, take note of the URI and select the key icon at the top to access to the shared access policy settings:

5. Select the Shared access policy called **iothubowner**, and take note of the **Primary key** and **connection string** in the right blade.  You should copy these into a text file for future use.

### Registering your device
You must register your device in order to be able to send and receive information from the Azure IoT Hub. This is done by registering a [Device Identity](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/iot-hub-devguide/#device-identity-registry) in the IoT Hub.

1. Open the Device Explorer app (C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\DeviceExplorer\DeviceExplorer.exe) and fill the **IoT Hub Connection String** field with the connection string of the IoT Hub you created in previous steps and click on **Update**.

2. Go to the **Management** tab and click on the **Create** button. The Create Device popup will be displayed. Fill the **Device ID** field with a new Id for your device (_myFirstDevice_ for example) and click on Create:

3. Once the device identity is created, it will be displayed in the grid. Right click on the identity you just created, select **Copy connection string for selected device** and take note of the value copied to your clipboard, since it will be required to connect your device with the IoT Hub.

	> **Note:** The device identities registration can be automated using the Azure IoT Hubs SDK. An example of how to do that can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-getstarted/#create-a-device-identity).
